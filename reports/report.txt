[command]/home/runner/work/_temp/14fd3bf6-9d6b-4113-870e-1128f2582dd2/terraform-bin plan -no-color -lock=false

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution
plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:
